# Install 'persistent' before installing zodbbrowser because *sigh*
# pip install collects the packages to be installed before installing them,
# and some of the packages (BTrees) have a setup_requires=['persistent'], which
# means setuptools will try to download the persistent egg (despite pip already
# having downloaded it), and on Rackspace VMs setuptools downloads over HTTPS
# suffer from mysterious truncation issues that cause md5 hash validation
# problems that break the build.  My hope is that if 'persistent' is already
# installed (not just downloaded) then setup.py egg_info will find it and use
# it instead of attempting to download it again.
# Upgrade pip because otherwise we can't find lxml wheels because the ABI tag
# format changed or something.
