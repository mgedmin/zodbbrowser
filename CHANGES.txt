0.7.1 (2010-03-30)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- IMPORTANT BUGFIX: don't leave old object states lying around in ZODB object
  cache, which could lead to DATA LOSS (LP#487243 strikes again, this time
  for OrderedContainers).

  I've audited the code and am fairly confident this bug is now dead dead
  dead.

- Try to discard data modifications when the DB is opened read-only.

- Avoid deprecated zope.testing.doctest.

- Avoid zope.app.securitypolicy; use zope.securitypolicy.


0.7 (2009-12-10)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Stopped using setuptools extras; now easy_install zodbbrowser is sufficient
  to run the standalone app.


0.6.1 (2009-12-09)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Compatibility with latest Zope packages, including ZODB 3.9.x.


0.6 (2009-12-07)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Ability to revert object state to an older version.  Requires a read-write
  database connection (i.e. run bin/zodbbrowser --rw).  The button is hidden
  and appears when you're hovering over a transaction entry in the list.
- Collapse long item lists by default.


0.5.1 (2009-11-23)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- IMPORTANT BUGFIX: don't leave old object states lying around in ZODB object
  cache, which could lead to DATA LOSS (LP#487243).  This affected OOBTree
  objects.


0.5 (2009-11-23)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Be a bit more tolerant to unpickling errors (show which revision could not
  be loaded instead of breaking the whole page).
- Show full history of OOBTree objects and subobjects (LP#474334).
- Change background color of links on hover, to make it clear what
  object you'll see when you click, especially when the __repr__ shown
  contains reprs of subobjects.
- Show size of containers next to the "Items" heading (LP#486910).
- Show size of containers next to their representation, e.g.
  "<persistent.dict.PersistentDict object at 0xad0b3ec> (0 items)".
- Pay attention when __name__ is declared as a class attribute (LP#484899).
- Show names of directly provided interfaces on objects (i.e. show a better
  representation of pickled zope.interface.Provides objects).
- Pretty-printing of dictionaries (including nested ones).


0.4 (2009-10-11)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- @@zodbbrowser oid and tid parameters now accept values in hex format (0x0123)
  Patch by Adam Groszer.


0.3.1 (2009-07-17)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed install error on Windows (path cannot end in /).


0.3 (2009-07-17)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- First public release
